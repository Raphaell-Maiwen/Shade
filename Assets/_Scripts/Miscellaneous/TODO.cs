    /*
     -Adjust the metrics for Shade
     -Questions to answer:

        -How long will we make the scenes? Do we have small scenes with level transitions, or ongoing levels with a moving camera?
        -Do we have wall jumps? Or any extra platforming mechanics (including platforms/ obstacles)
            something time-based (like a toaster)
            have hostile platforms (+checkpoints?)
            swinging

    -Ideas:
        -Just have a straightforward path at the beginning, with one block to place right
        -
        -When the flashlight is introduced, it is stationary (as to show the mechanic without giving too much affordability, a bit like in Portal)

     -Make a Character class. Avatar and ShadowCharacter will inherit from it (since there is so many resemblances)
